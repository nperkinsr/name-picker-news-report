# Name Picker: News Report
**Name Picker: News Report** is a playful project where a random name is inserted into one of many absurd fake news headlines. Users enter a list of names, and upon clicking the **Pick a Name** button, one is chosen at random and dropped into a pre-written ridiculous news report.

You might get something like:
**BREAKING NEWS!**
_Arthur has been fined Â£100 for failing to do the mandatory 'little nod' when letting someone merge in traffic. Police call it an 'act of chaos'._

This project was created to practise random array selection and string manipulation, with an added focus on making the experience fun, weird, and unpredictable.
